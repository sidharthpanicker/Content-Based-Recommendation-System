Help:Development stages From Wikibooks, open books for an open world Jump to navigation Jump to search Shortcut: WB:STAGES Development stages are little indicators placed next to a link to a book or a page to indicate its progress, as reviewed at a certain date. They also are used on a book's main page to indicate the book's progress as a whole. They help readers identify comprehensive content, while drawing editors' attention to pages needing work. Wikibook Development Stages Sparse text Developing text Maturing text Developed text Comprehensive text Contents 1 Quart stages 2 Deci-stages 3 Book completion status 4 TODO list Quart stages There are two templates that create the quart stages indicators: {{stage}} and {{stage short}}. They take the development stage as their first argument and a date as an optional second: Markup Displays as [[Main Page]] {{stage|100%|Jan 11, 2005}} Main Page (Jan 11, 2005) [[Main Page]] {{stage short|100%|Jan 11, 2005}} Main Page If the second parameter is not included in the {{stage}} template the date will not be displayed. Deci-stages The {{decistage}} template creates an indicator with ten stages: Markup Displays as [[Main Page]] {{decistage|10|Jan 11, 2005}} Main Page Book completion status Readers browsing through a certain subject area or classification often want to view books that are complete or closer to completion. In order to indicate the level of completion for a book, add {{status|<PROGRESS>}} to a book's main page, where <PROGRESS> is one of the following: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%. Don't abuse this to try to make your book more popular; misleading readers will cause them to leave in frustration. Use To put a book in {{status|100%}} Completed books {{status|75%}} Books nearing completion {{status|50%}} Half-finished books {{status|25%}} Partly developed books {{status|0%}} Freshly started books TODO list Sometimes it's very hard to figure out what should be added in one page rather than in another. If you evaluate a page to an incomplete stage, you know what is missing. So don't forget to fill a TODO list. Add {{Todo|<MISSING>}} to the page, where <MISSING> is a text describing what should be added to make the page complete.
