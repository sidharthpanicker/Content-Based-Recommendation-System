Documentation The Java™ Tutorials Home Page « Previous • Trail • Next » The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases. Trail: JavaBeans(TM) JavaBeans™ makes it easy to reuse software components. Developers can use software components written by others without having to understand their inner workings. To understand why software components are useful, think of a worker assembling a car. Instead of building a radio from scratch, for example, she simply obtains a radio and hooks it up with the rest of the car. This trail describes JavaBeans using the following lessons: Quick Start provides a speedy introduction to JavaBeans by showing how to build applications with NetBeans. Writing JavaBeans Components describes the coding patterns used for bean properties, methods, and events. It also outlines the use of a BeanInfo to customize the development experience in a builder tool. Advanced JavaBeans Topics covers bean persistence, long term persistence, and customization. « Previous • TOC • Next » About Oracle | Contact Us | Legal Notices | Terms of Use | Your Privacy Rights Copyright © 1995, 2017 Oracle and/or its affiliates.
