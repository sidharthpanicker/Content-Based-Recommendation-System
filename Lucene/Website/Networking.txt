The workstations would just render the information sent in from the Mainframe console. But in the mid 90's, with the prices of Unix servers dropping, the trend was moving away from Mainframe computing toward Client-Server computing. This would enable rich clients to be developed on workstations while they would communicate with a centralized server, serving computers connected to it, to either communicate with other workstations also connected to it or it would request for database access or business logic stored on the server itself. The workstations were called clients. This form of computing gave rise to the notion of the Front-end and Back-end programming. In it's hey-day, Java came up with different ways of making networking between computers possible. In this chapter, we would be looking at some of these ways. Listed below are two of the frameworks that Java uses to enable network programming. We would be exploring both of these in this chapter. Client-Server programming[edit] Networking basics Creating a simple server Listening for clients Creating a client to interact with the server Sending information over a network Building complex carriage routines Remote Method Invocation (RMI)[edit] Basics of Remote Method Invocation Of stubs and proxies Reflection/Accessing Private Features with Reflection Java Programming Networking Database Programming Retrieved from "https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Java_Programming/Networking&oldid=3295235" Category: Book:Java Programming Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Discussion for this IP address Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Book Discussion Variants Views Read Latest draft Edit View history More Search Navigation Main Page Help Browse Cookbook Wikijunior Featured books Recent changes Donations Random book Using Wikibooks Community Reading room Community portal Bulletin Board Help out!
