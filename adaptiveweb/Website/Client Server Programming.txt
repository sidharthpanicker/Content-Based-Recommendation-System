The database access and some business logic were centralized on the back-end server, collecting data from the user program was installed on the front-end users' "client" computers. In the Java world there are three main ways the front-end and the back-end can communicate. The client application uses JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity API) to connect to the data base server, (Limited business logic on the back-end, unless using Stored procedures). The client application uses RMI (Remote Method Invocation) to communicate with the back-end. The client application uses a socket connection to communicate with the back-end. Socket Connection Example[edit] Figure 1:Simple Client Server Implementation This page shows an example of a socket connection. Create a Server[edit] The Java language was developed having network computing in mind. For this reason it is very easy to create a server program. A server is a piece of code that runs all the time listening on a particular port on the computer for incoming requests. When a request arrives, it starts a new thread to service the request. See the following example: Listening on a port[edit] ComServer class is for listening on a port for a client. Code listing 1.1: ComServer import java.net.ServerSocket;
/**
 * -- Main Server Class; Listening on a port for client; If there is a client,
 * starts a new Thread and goes back to listening for further clients. --
 */
public class ComServer 
{
static boolean  GL_listening = true;
   /**
    * -- Main program to start the Server --
    */
   public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
   {
      ComServer srv = new ComServer();
      srv.listen(); 
   } // --- End of Main Method ---

   /**
    * -- Server method; Listen for client --
    */
   public int listen() throws IOException
   {
    ServerSocket serverSocket = null;
    int iPortNumber = 9090;

       // --- Open the Server Socket where this should listen ---
       try {
           System.out.println( "*** Open the listening socket; at:"+ iPortNumber + " ***" );
           serverSocket = new ServerSocket( iPortNumber );
       } catch (IOException e) {
           System.err.println("Could not listen on port:"+iPortNumber );
           System.exit(1);
       }
       while ( GL_listening )
       {
        ComServerThread clientServ; 
           // --- Listening for client; If there is a client start a Thread -
           System.out.println( "*** Listen for a Client; at:"+ iPortNumber + " ***" );
           clientServ = new ComServerThread( serverSocket.accept() );
           // --- Service a Client ---
           System.out.println( "*** A Client came; Service it ***" );
           clientServ.start();   /* --- Use for multy Threaded --- */
      //     clientServ.run();    /* --- Use for Single Threaded --- */
       }

       // --- Close the Server socket;  Server exiting ---
       serverSocket.close();
    return 0;
   } // --- End of listen Method --- 
}  // --- End of ComServer Class ---
 ServerSocket( iPortNumber ) Creates a server socket, bound to the specified port. serverSocket.accept() Listens for a connection to be made to this socket and accepts it. The method blocks until a connection is made. It returns a new Socket. Service One Client[edit] ComServerThread This class extended from a Thread is responsible to service one client. The Socket connection will be open between the client and server. A simple protocol has to be defined between the client and server, the server has to understand what the client wants from the server. The client will send a terminate command, for which the server will terminate the socket connection. The ComServerThread class is responsible to handle all client requests, until the client sends a terminate command. Code listing 1.2: ComServerThread  /**

Handling the request; implements the communication protocol[edit] ComProtocol This class implements, and encapsulates the communication logic (protocol). The protocol is the following: The client initiate the connection. The server accepts it and sends an acknowledgment notifying that it's ready The client sends a request The server response based on the request ... The client sends a BYE request The server acknowledge the BYE request and disconnects the socket connection The client gets the acknowledgment to the BYE ... The client sends a SHUTDOWN request The server acknowledge the SHUTDOWN request and disconnects and also stops listening of other clients. The client gets the acknowledgment to the SHUTDOWN Code listing 1.3: ComProtocol  class '''ComProtocol'''
